# 🚀 km2miles - A Blueprint for Python Package Development  

## 📌 Introduction  

**km2miles** is a simple Python package that converts kilometers to miles. While the core functionality is trivial, this project serves as a **case study** for developing an **industry-standard Python package** from scratch.  

The real **purpose** of this project is not the function itself but the **process we followed**—which mirrors the methodologies used in professional software engineering teams. This package is an **example of best practices** in project structure, versioning, dependency management, automated testing, CI/CD, and package deployment to PyPI.  

Through this project, we explored **Poetry for package management**, **automated testing with pytest**, **GitHub Actions for CI/CD**, and a **structured, scalable approach to Python package development**. The same principles applied here can be extended to any real-world software project.

## 📺 Project Overview  

### 🌟 Features  

✅ **Simple & Efficient** – Converts kilometers to miles with a precise mathematical formula.  
✅ **Poetry-Powered** – Modern dependency management and packaging.  
✅ **Well-Structured Codebase** – Follows the recommended `src/` layout for clarity and maintainability.  
✅ **Automated Testing** – Uses `pytest` to ensure reliability and correctness.  
✅ **CI/CD Integration** – Includes GitHub Actions for automatic testing and deployment.  
✅ **PyPI Publishing** – Ready to be shared with the Python community via PyPI.  
✅ **Scalability & Best Practices** – Follows a structured workflow, making it an ideal reference for industry projects.  

### 📌 Why **km2miles**?  

This package was chosen **deliberately** to focus **not on complexity** but on the **end-to-end development lifecycle** of a Python package. It is a **small but complete** example demonstrating:  

- **How to start a package project properly**  
- **How to organize the codebase for maintainability**  
- **How to implement testing & automation**  
- **How to manage dependencies & versioning correctly**  
- **How to publish a package on PyPI seamlessly**  

Even though **km2miles** itself may not solve a real-world problem, **the workflow behind it is exactly how enterprise-grade Python libraries are built**.
